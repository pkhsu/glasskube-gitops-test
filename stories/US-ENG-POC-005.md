# US-ENG-POC-005: Preliminary Comparison of Glasskube vs Helm/Kustomize in Edge Scenarios

## User Story
As an engineer for the APP Center solution,  
I want to compare the advantages and disadvantages of Glasskube relative to Helm and Kustomize for Edge device package management based on PoC observations and official documentation,  
So that I can provide rationale for technology selection and explain to POs and architects why Glasskube was chosen.

## Acceptance Criteria
- **AC1:** List at least 3-5 important package management considerations in Edge Computing scenarios (e.g., resource usage, offline capabilities, ease of use, integration potential with central management tools, adaptation to MicroK8s, etc.).
- **AC2:** Briefly analyze Glasskube's performance on the above considerations (based on PoC experience and documentation).
- **AC3:** Briefly analyze Helm's potential advantages and disadvantages on Edge (based on known information and speculation).
- **AC4:** Briefly analyze Kustomize's potential advantages and disadvantages on Edge (based on known information and speculation).
- **AC5:** Produce a concise comparison summary highlighting Glasskube's potential advantages or points to note in the target scenario.
