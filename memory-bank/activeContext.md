# Active Context

## Current Focus
The current focus is on preparing for integration testing of the Glasskube package repository. We've implemented a solution that avoids file duplication by using direct references to original application files.

## Recent Changes
1. Created a complete Glasskube package repository structure
2. Implemented package definitions for both Shiori and Sample Web App
3. Created Docker-based Caddy server script for hosting the repository
4. Updated documentation to reflect the direct file reference approach
5. Cleaned up redundant files and scripts

## Next Steps
1. Run comprehensive integration tests to verify package installations work correctly
2. Address any issues discovered during testing
3. Consider potential improvements for production deployment
4. Document test results and any additional findings

## Active Decisions

### Direct File References
We decided to use direct references to original application files (/apps/* directory) in the package.yaml definitions instead of duplicating files. This approach:
- Eliminates redundancy and maintenance overhead
- Creates a single source of truth for application manifests
- Simplifies updates when application files change

### Docker-Based Hosting
We chose to use Docker with Caddy for hosting the package repository because:
- It provides a consistent environment across different machines
- Requires minimal setup (just Docker)
- Can easily serve the entire project directory structure
- Is suitable for both development and testing

### Package Configuration Strategy
For both packages, we implemented valueDefinitions that allow end-users to customize:
- For Shiori: hostname, replicas, and storage size
- For Sample Web App: replica count, ingress enablement, and ingress hostname

## Key Insights
1. **Single Source of Truth**: The direct file reference approach creates a clean separation between application sources and package definitions
2. **Path Resolution**: The key to making direct references work is ensuring the static server is started from the project root
3. **Docker Simplicity**: Using Docker for the repository server eliminates environment-specific setup issues
4. **Value Targeting**: The valueDefinitions targeting system in Glasskube is powerful for patching specific parts of manifests or charts

## Current Patterns and Preferences
1. Keep application files in their original location
2. Use Docker for consistent environments
3. Favor clear documentation over implicit understanding
4. Design for single source of truth
5. Provide customization options via valueDefinitions
