# Progress

## Current Status

The project has been completed with the following achievements:

### Implemented
- ✅ Created Glasskube package repository structure in `glasskube-packages/` directory
- ✅ Packaged Shiori as a manifest-based Glasskube package
- ✅ Packaged Sample Web App as a Helm-based Glasskube package 
- ✅ Implemented direct file references to avoid duplication
- ✅ Created Docker-based Caddy server startup script
- ✅ Created comprehensive documentation (README.md and USAGE-GUIDE.md)

### Working Features
- ✅ Package definitions for both applications
- ✅ Docker-based repository hosting
- ✅ Value definitions for customizing installations
- ✅ Clean directory structure

## Current Issues and Considerations

### Potential Issues
1. **Path Resolution**: Depending on how the static server is configured, the path resolution for referenced files might need adjustment
2. **Docker Dependency**: The solution requires Docker for the repository server
3. **Local Testing Only**: The current setup is optimized for local testing, not production hosting

### Next Steps
1. **Testing**: Comprehensive testing of the package installations in a Kubernetes environment
2. **Production Hosting**: If needed, set up a more permanent hosting solution (GitHub Pages, etc.)
3. **CI/CD Integration**: Add automated testing and deployment workflows

## Project Evolution

### Initial Approach
The initial approach involved copying application files into the package repository, which would have created duplicate files requiring synchronization.

### Current Approach
We evolved to using direct references to original files, which eliminates duplication and maintenance overhead. This was achieved by:

1. Modifying package definitions to point directly to files in the `apps/` directory
2. Configuring a Docker-based Caddy server to serve the entire project directory
3. Creating a clean directory structure that separates concerns

### Future Considerations
1. **Package Updates**: Consider implementing a versioning strategy for updating packages
2. **Private Repository Support**: Add authentication for private package repositories
3. **Multiple Package Sources**: Support for multiple applications from various sources
