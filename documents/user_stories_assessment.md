# Glasskube Package Manager PoC User Stories Assessment

This document provides an assessment of the current codebase against the acceptance criteria defined in the user stories.

## US-ENG-POC-001: Validate Glasskube's Basic Package Management Capabilities on MicroK8s

| Acceptance Criteria | Status | Notes |
|---------------------|--------|-------|
| **AC1:** Successfully install Glasskube in a MicroK8s environment. | ✅ | Installation instructions are available in documentation. |
| **AC2:** Use Glasskube CLI to search for available sample application packages. | ✅ | The codebase supports searching packages with `glasskube list` command. |
| **AC3:** Use Glasskube CLI to successfully install a sample application package to MicroK8s. | ✅ | Sample applications (shiori, sample-web-app) can be installed with clear commands. |
| **AC4:** Use Glasskube CLI to list installed application packages with their versions and status. | ✅ | The codebase supports listing installed packages with `glasskube list -i`. |
| **AC5:** Use Glasskube CLI to successfully upgrade an installed application package to a new version. | ✅ | The codebase supports upgrading packages with `glasskube update`. |
| **AC6:** Use Glasskube CLI to successfully remove an installed application package. | ✅ | The codebase supports removing packages with `glasskube uninstall`. |
| **AC7:** (Risk assessment) Document the resource consumption (CPU, Memory) of Glasskube on MicroK8s. | ⚠️ | No existing documentation about resource consumption. This would need to be measured during testing. |

### Summary
The codebase meets most of the acceptance criteria for basic package management capabilities, but resource consumption measurement (AC7) still needs to be conducted during testing.

## US-ENG-POC-004: Validate Glasskube's Offline/Local Deployment Capabilities

| Acceptance Criteria | Status | Notes |
|---------------------|--------|-------|
| **AC1:** Package a Glasskube application and its dependencies into offline installation files. | ⚠️ | No clear documentation or implementation for packaging applications for offline installation. |
| **AC2:** Transfer the offline installation files to an offline Edge device. | ⚠️ | No documentation about transferring offline installation files. |
| **AC3:** Successfully install the application using Glasskube CLI through the offline files. | ⚠️ | No documentation about installing applications from offline files. |
| **AC4:** (Risk assessment) Evaluate the complexity and usability of creating, transferring, and installing offline packages. | ⚠️ | Cannot evaluate complexity as the feature implementation is not apparent in the codebase. |

### Summary
The codebase does not appear to have clear support for offline deployment capabilities. The current implementation seems to rely on online repositories (GitHub raw URLs). Further investigation is needed to determine if this capability exists or would need to be developed.

## US-ENG-POC-005: Preliminary Comparison of Glasskube vs Helm/Kustomize in Edge Scenarios

| Acceptance Criteria | Status | Notes |
|---------------------|--------|-------|
| **AC1:** List at least 3-5 important package management considerations in Edge Computing scenarios. | ⚠️ | No existing comparison document in the codebase. |
| **AC2:** Briefly analyze Glasskube's performance on the above considerations. | ⚠️ | No existing analysis in the codebase. |
| **AC3:** Briefly analyze Helm's potential advantages and disadvantages on Edge. | ⚠️ | No existing analysis in the codebase. |
| **AC4:** Briefly analyze Kustomize's potential advantages and disadvantages on Edge. | ⚠️ | No existing analysis in the codebase. |
| **AC5:** Produce a concise comparison summary. | ⚠️ | No existing comparison summary in the codebase. |

### Summary
There is no existing comparison documentation in the codebase. There is a hint in the documentation that Glasskube is designed to be more efficient than Helm or Kustomize, claiming to be "20 times faster" for deployment, updates, and configuration on Kubernetes. A comprehensive comparison would need to be created based on experiences during testing.

## Overall Recommendations

To fully satisfy all acceptance criteria, the following actions are recommended:

1. **For US-ENG-POC-001:**
   - Conduct resource consumption measurements for Glasskube on MicroK8s (AC7)

2. **For US-ENG-POC-004:**
   - Investigate if Glasskube has any offline deployment capabilities
   - If not supported, determine what would be needed to implement this feature
   - Document potential approaches for offline package management

3. **For US-ENG-POC-005:**
   - Define key considerations for package management in Edge Computing scenarios
   - Test and compare Glasskube, Helm, and Kustomize based on these considerations
   - Create a comparison document with findings and recommendations
